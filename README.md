# React challenge JungleDev!

This project was developed by [Lucival dos Santos Fran√ßa Filho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucivalfrancafilho/), as technical challenge. The objective was to replicate a ready-made design shared through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iBxoiuoSXy3SiOAnwXo2Np/Frontend-%E2%80%93-Challenge-1).

## Instructions to run the development build
1. Open terminal in path folder that you want to clone

2. Clone repo
   - `git clone `
   - Enter the repo folder you just clone
   - `cd jungle-challenge`

3. Install the dependencies and start the project
    - Install dependencies:
      - `npm install`
    - start the project
      - `npm start`

    Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Instructions to create a production build
1. Open terminal in project path folder
2. Run build command
   - `npm run build`

   OBS: You may serve it with a static server:
        `npm install -g serve`
        `serve -s build`

Then you'll have a production ready build in the `build` folder.
This method correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
